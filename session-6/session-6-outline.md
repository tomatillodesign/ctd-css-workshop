# Code the Dream Intro to CSS Workshop Session 6
_June 4, 2019 â€¢ Chris Liu-Beers, [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com/)_

This is our last class! Great job :clap::tada:<br/>
I will be back here next week from 3-5p to answer questions or help with any code/projects that you may have.

## Client Work Review
- What was the most challenging part of the assignment? What part was the easiest?
- If a friend sent you this request tomorrow, would you take it? Why or why not?

## CSS Concepts
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
     - SCSS must be compiled into regular CSS
     - You can use variables in SCSS (eg `$primaryColor : #4FE876;`)
     - Nested items
     - Split your stylesheet into multiple smaller files
     - Create small functions, called "mixins"
     - Inherit styles using "@extend"
     - Calculations

     - [The basic concepts of Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
     - [20 minute video](https://youtu.be/FTlczfR82mQ)
- [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
     - [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/)

## Individual Activity
- Refactor your cards from Session 2 to use CSS Flexbox and/or Grid. Please make sure that each card has an image, and that you have 6 total (in two rows of 3 each). Remember that you can adjust your own markup and CSS as necessary to get the Flexbox/Grid to work.
- BONUS #1: Use SASS in Codepen to create several variables, then use them in your code
- BONUS #1: Use SASS in Codepen to create a mixin and run it in your code
