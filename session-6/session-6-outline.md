_June 4, 2019 â€¢ Chris Liu-Beers, [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com/)_
_This is our last class! Great job :clap::tada: I will be back here next week from 3-5p to answer questions or help with any code/projects that you may have.

## Client Work Review
- What was the most challenging part of the assignment? What part was the easiest?
- If a friend sent you this request tomorrow, would you take it? Why or why not?

## CSS Concepts
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

## Individual Activity
- Refactor your cards from Session 2 to use CSS Flexbox and/or Grid. Please make sure that each card has an image, and that you have 6 total (in two rows of 3 each). Remember that you can adjust your own markup and CSS as necessary to get the Grid to work.
- BONUS #1: Use SASS in Codepen to create several variables, then use them in your code
- BONUS #1: Use SASS in Codepen to create a mixin and run it in your code
